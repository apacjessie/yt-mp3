# YT-MP3 Script

YT-MP3 Script is a simple command-line tool for downloading audio from YouTube videos and converting them to MP3 format. If you find yourself repeatedly typing out the same command `yt-dlp --audio-format mp3 --audio-quality 0 yt_url`, this script can automate the process for you.

## Why YT-MP3 Script?

As the creator of YT-MP3 Script, I developed this tool to simplify my own workflow for downloading audio from YouTube videos. Manually typing out the `yt-dlp --audio-format mp3 --audio-quality 0 yt_url` command each time I wanted to download audio was tedious and time-consuming. With YT-MP3 Script, I can now accomplish this task with just a single command, saving myself time and effort.
